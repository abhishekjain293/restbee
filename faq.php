                    We are a match-making company, just not matrimonial. There are days, when we don't have time to even step outside of our place of living or of work. And then there are days when we are too free to do anything. Everything between just counts automaticaly. RestBee implements this simple solution to this widespread problem. If Inuja being at place A want something from place B, there is always a Binuja travelling from B to A. What we do is simply match Inuja and Binuja. Binuja takes with him the requirement of Inuja on the way. Inuja gets the product. Binja gets Travel Reimbursement. We get your Love.

                    No. Not at all. Binujas are in no way employees/clients/agents of RestBee. All Binujas are registered users of RestBee in the same way as Inujas are. Anyone can be a Binuja and all you need for being one is a smartphone and willingness to be.
					Being a Binuja gives you a opportunity to earn some extra cash or at the very least travel for free, from anywhere to anywhere.
